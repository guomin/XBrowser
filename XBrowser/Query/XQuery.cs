	/* Some simple rules about jQuery:
	 * 
	 * parsing operates in a context which is a set of included elements
	 * no elements are selected in a blank query- a selector is required in order to obtain a subset of elements from the context
	 * a new (raw) context draws from any available node in the tree, unlike an empty context which is the result of selections with no matches
	 * a filtered context only operates on nodes that are selected within the context (which could be none if selectors have filtered out all nodes)
	 * a query should always start and end with a selector- a query starting or ending with a shift operator is invalid
	 * context is cloned for subqueries, as the context may alter during a subquery but need to be reset upon resolution of the subquery e.g. :not(p > b)
	
	 * there are five types of selectors:
		 * #id - select an element by its 'id' attribute - starts with a hash
		 * .class - select an element by its 'class' attribute - starts with a period
		 * tag - selects an element according to its tag name - starts with a letter
		 * [attribute filter] - selects an element by the existence of, or value of, an attribute with a given name - starts with a square bracket
		 * :named filter - selects elements that match a defined rule (note that this type of selector can select and include elements outside of the current selection) - starts with a colon
	
	 * shift operators traverse the context - they are:
		* > filter context to children of existing selection
		* [space] filter context to descendents of existing selection
		* + filter context to next adjacent siblings of existing selection
